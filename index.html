<!--Welcome to my site, if you are reading this you probably know something about web design, or at least enough to use the Inspect Editor tool :P
Resources that helped me along the way:

- bootzee.com (editor)
- bluehost.com (hosting)
- getbootstrap.com (reference)
- codecademy.com (learning)
- scrolling-nav.js (js feature)
- typed.js (js feature)

Special Thanks to: RV and JS for helping me along the way. 

**Created by John Thomas Bicket as a display of my own artistic expression in coding and as a result of many months dedicated to learning web design.

                    <p class="lead text-left">My name is John Thomas Bicket, most people call me JT, and I am a 17 year old high school student from Charlotte, North Carolina. I am an avid martial artist and amateur web programmer, among other things... In my free time I enjoy
                        working out, having meaningful conversations, and hanging with friends. I have a pretty broad interest in music, and I like action/adventure movies. During the summer I enjoy wakeboarding, cliff diving, and driving with the convertible
                        top down. In the winter I like snowboarding, building log fires, and wishing it was summer!
                        <br>
                        <br>I am currently a junior in high school, and I plan on attending college to major in Business. I've always had an interest in business, leadership, and technology - something that might sound a little mature for my age, but ehh...
                        at least I know what I want to do. My dream job would be working as a CEO or CIO (head of technology) for a company. I am an active part of my church's youth group and volunteer at things like <a href="http://joyprom.org/" target="_blank">JoyProm</a>.
                        Welcome to my website!</p>

                    <p class="lead text-right">I have been actively training in Martial Arts since 2008. In 2013 I earned my 1st Degree Blackbelt. In 2015 I earned my 2nd Degree Blackbelt, my current rank. Since May of 2014 I have been apart of the teaching staff at my martial
                        arts school. Being able to coach others, teach classes, and train as my high-school job is such an awesome experience. I get to do something I enjoy, stay in shape, teach others, train with friends, and build skills I will use
                        later in life - I am humbly grateful for the opportunity to work there. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing" target="_blank">Boxing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judo" target="_blank">Judo</a> aspect
                        of training is what I enjoy most, something that I plan on continuing in college.
                        <br>
                        <br>Martial Arts has opened up a wide range of opportuntiies for me. One of these is a trip I'm taking this summer to Los Angeles, California. For a week me and some of the other blackbelts at our school will be training at the International
                        Martial Arts and Boxing Academy, the Tempest Freerunning Academy, and a few others. I can't wait for this trip and I'm sure it will be a highlight of my summer this year!</p>

                    <p class="lead text-left">I have always enjoyed learning new things, and about a year ago I started getting really interested in learning to code. The ability to use coding to manipulate the world around you and design something that could be used and seen
                        everywhere seemed really cool to me. Through a series of events I had the opportunity to build a relationship with the CIO of a large Minnesota based company. He has been a great source of advice and I am really thankful for his
                        "mentoring" as I have continued to learn.
                        <br>
                        <br>Web design is only one facet of my life - just like school, martial arts, and wakeboarding; but I've really come to enjoy it. I'm excited to learn what I can about coding so I can apply these skills to a job down the road, create
                        cool and useful websites/apps, and so I can freelance to help others with their goals. Again, I can't go without mentioning my Minnesota friend as an inspiration for me to pursue web programming. I hope to take what I learned from
                        him and return the favor - helping others and their interest in web programming!</p>

                            <p>In early 2016 I began assisting the technology department at my school with helping other students interested in web programming dive into coding. I've really enjoyed this as it allows me to continue building my own knowledge

                                            <h4>How It All Began</h4>
                                            <p>I started building www.jtbicket.com in January 2016. It originally began as a project for my web design class at school, but it quickly grew into a full fledged programming project. As I studied more and more about web development I decided to launch my own personal website where I could practice all of the things I was learning.</p>
                                            <h4>The Reason</h4>
                                            <p>There are a couple of reasons for why I decided to create this website:
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><b>A good online presence.</b> Technology is continuing to improve and the web is becoming biggger and biger every day. It is more and more common for people to Google one another these days and the results that come up can create a positive or negative impression on their opinion of you before they even get to know you. Just as your want to have a good first impression when you meet someone, I want to have a good online presence when people look me up. Being able to have a positive online presence is good for future jobs, internships, and collages as I'm able to give them insight into who I am without them having the opportunity to meet me.</li>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <li><b>A unique website.</b> Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites always have a place in your about section to put a URL link to a website. I've always wanted to be able to put something
                                                        there as people don't normally use that space. Now...I can XD. This is less of a reason to why I made this site and more of just a kinda of humorous benefit.</li>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <li><b>A place to practice</b>. I created www.jtbicket.com so I could practice many of the new things that I was learning in Web Development. I wanted to continue trying new things and improving on what I had created. My own website also allows me to show my latest work in web design and allows for me try out new ideas and inspirations.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <br>
                                                <h4>The Process</h4>
                                                <p>From inception to launch this website took over a month to develop, write, and publish. I goal is to always to give off this sense of orginally in my work, as it is much more difficult (and fulfilling)
                                                    when you actually code a web project on your own as opposed to just using a website creator. I don't do this to show off, but rather to display the progress I'm making in learning web programming. I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far, but I understand that there is still much for me to learn. My personal website will improve over time as I gain more and more experience - my goal is to always be working on new ideas for my site and other projects.</p>
